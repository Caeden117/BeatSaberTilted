# Tilted - A Beat Saber Plugin
A plugin that fucks up the scene when you fuck up. *This plugin may crash the game when exiting the level.*

# Setup
Add the release .dll to `<Beat Saber Directory>/Plugins` and start the game. A configuration file will automatically be created in `<Beat Saber Directory>/UserData/Tilted.txt`.

# Configuration
`enabled` *(Default: true)* | Toggles the plugin on/off.

`scalar` *(Default: 10)* |  A float value of how fucked up the scene will get every time the function gets called. Negative numbers will work!

`avoidFiltersBecauseYouAreAFuckingMadManAndItWillMakeBeatSaberUnplayable` *(Default: true)* | Toggles the built-in filters that make the plugin actually playable. ***BY ENABLING THIS OPTION, BEAT SABER WILL BECOME UNPLAYABLE AND MOST LIKELY CRASH WHEN EXITING A LEVEL.***
